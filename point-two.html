        <p style="font-size:18px;">
                    
            Today, speed is very important. Things are changing very fast and people are losing their jobs and businesses in the process. Learning new skills is one way you can constantly stay on top of your game. 
            <br>The best way to break into a new industry or level in your business is to learn a new skill. Now more than ever, it is much easier and convenient to acquire a new skill in as little as six months, even as a pastime. 
            <br>The following are some lucrative skills you can learn in less than six months that are sure to place you ahead:
        </p>

        <h6 style="font-size:22px; font-weight:700;">1. Public Speaking</h6>
        <p style="font-size:18px;">
            The ability to captivate an audience is such an invaluable skill. With verbal confidence, you can more easily pitch your ideas, sell products and accomplish your dreams. If you cannot speak well and comfortably in public you are sure to lose a lot of money and opportunities. 
            Interestingly, lots of people are still scared of speaking in public. But you don’t have to be. You can learn to speak like a pro with free resources from Udemy, Alison, edx and YouTube, after which you can practice what you learn with a physical or online audience.

        </p>
        
        <h6 style="font-size:22px; font-weight:700;">2. Foreign Languages </h6>
        <p style="font-size:18px;">
            Learning a foreign language can be quite challenging, but the benefits are well worth the effort.  A new language will definitely give you a competitive advantage in the global market. Companies need employees who can communicate with their foreign investors. And if you are in business for yourself and have a need to go global, this is one skill that will help you immensely. 
            All it requires is for you to free up some study time, say an hour, each day. Within 6 months you would have mastered your target language to an appreciable level of fluency. 
            You can access lots of language resources from sites like Duolingo.com, Openculture.com, Busuu.com and Livemocha.com to mention a few. 

        </p>

        <h6 style="font-size:22px; font-weight:700;">
            3. Real Estate Brokering
        </h6>
        <p style="font-size:18px;">
            The Real Estate market is still very profitable, and properties are being traded in every known location. You only need to learn how to connect the sellers to the buyers for a nice commission. What’s more, this can be done as a side job.
            You can start learning the ropes from resources on: Udemy, Alison.com and YouTube.

        </p>

        <h6 style="font-size:22px; font-weight:700;">4. UI/UX Design</h6>
        <p style="font-size:18px;">
            User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) design are integral aspects of web development that are both lucrative and fairly easy to master. UI/UX designers seek to create easy, efficient, relevant and all-round pleasant experiences for the users of a website. They are the brains behind aesthetic, modern and eye-catching webpages.
            There are lots of online resources to get you started on this skill, and most of them are absolutely free. Check out some of them on udemy, pluralsight and freecodecamp.
        </p>

        <h6 style="font-size:22px; font-weight:700;">5. Video Editing and Production </h6>
        <p style="font-size:18px;">
            This is a hot skill to learn especially in this Covid-19 era. Production and consumption of video content this season has been at a record high. And it’s wise to cash in on it.
            Like every other skill, you need to dedicate time and resources to be able to produce good videos. It’s advisable you learn from an expert for a possible fee. You may also complement your training with free online courses from Udemy, Alison.com, skillsouter.com and YouTube.

        </p>
        <p style="font-size:18px;">
            
            In conclusion, you should not expect an improvement in your finances by doing things the same old way. Learning a new skill is a sure way to tip the financial scales in your favour. Don’t let this year’s end meet you without having learnt anything new.  
            The best time to start learning it is NOW. Make up your mind. Decide on a skill you must learn. Draw up a study schedule and you will be glad you did so in the end.
