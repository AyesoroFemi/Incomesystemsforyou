            <h3 style="font-size:22px; font-weight:700;"> EXCELLENT ALTERNATIVE INCOME OPTIONS FOR TEACHERS</h3>
            <p style="font-size:18px;">
                In a perfect world, teachers should be well off financially. But that’s not the case unfortunately, especially in these uncertain times. As such, there’s urgent need for feasible alternative income options for educators- options that are Covid-19 proof.  
                The following are guaranteed alternative income options teachers can consider:
            </p>

            <h6 style="font-size:22px; font-weight:700;">  1. Online Tutoring</h6>
            <p style="font-size:18px;">
                Thanks to the internet, innovations and technologies. You can now make money in your free time teaching students in need of your expertise from home. You can choose to sign up with an existing online tutoring network (such as VIPKIDS and hamoye.com) or you can start your own independent online tutoring business.

            </p>
            
            <h6 style="font-size:22px; font-weight:700;">2. E-book Writing</h6>
            <p style="font-size:18px;">
                As a teacher, you are already familiar with the challenges your students are facing in your area of expertise. And the chances are high that other students have the same challenge. Simply package the solution in form of an e-book (in PDF or word format) and sell to the students online. You can choose to self-promote your e-book or sell it on established platforms like KINDLE DIRECT PUBLISHING.

            </p>
            <h6 style="font-size:22px; font-weight:700;">  3. Marketing Talents and Skills Online</h6>
            
            <p style="font-size:18px;">
                Every teacher has some natural talent or skill they’ve acquired that solves a specific problem. This could be anything from singing, drawing, playing musical instruments, photography, public speaking, etc. All that needs to be done is to identify, refine and monetize the chosen skill. You might need to recruit lots of assistance though, in putting it all together.  

            </p>
            <h6 style="font-size:22px; font-weight:700;"> 4. Working as a Virtual Assistant  </h6>
            <p style="font-size:18px;">
                A virtual assistant is someone who provides a variety of administrative support services to clients from home or a remote location. A virtual assistant's tasks would include scheduling appointments, making phone calls, internet research, data entry, event planning, making travel arrangements, and managing email accounts. With good communication skills and basic computer know-how, you should be good to go for this job.

            </p>
            <h6 style="font-size:22px; font-weight:700;"> 5. Writing for Educational Sites</h6>
            <p style="font-size:18px;">
                Many educational websites are in need of writers in their peculiar niches. You can surf the internet for sites looking for articles in your field and pitch to them. Some even have magazines that you can contribute regularly to for pay.
            </p>
            <h6 style="font-size:22px; font-weight:700;">  6. Social Media Management</h6>
            <p style="font-size:18px;">
                Many companies that want to appeal to the youth take their social media presence very serious. They're more than willing to pay someone who can manage it well for them. As a social media manager, you are expected to be the eyes, ears and mouth of the company on the social media space, and generally their online presence. 
                If you are naturally tech savvy and good with social media, you're good to go.
        
            </p>
            <h6 style="font-size:22px; font-weight:700;">   7. Grant Writing </h6>
            <p style="font-size:18px;">
                This involves seeking and applying for grants (especially research funds), on behalf of clients, from foundations, government entities and other funding sources. With minimal know-how, you can serve as a matchmaker between grant-awarding institutions and individuals that need them. Your ability to write persuasively and in an organized manner is very important though.

            </p>
            <h6 style="font-size:22px; font-weight:700;"> 8. Speech Writing & Public Speaking Instructing </h6>
            <p style="font-size:18px;">
                A teacher good at speaking can easily become a speech writer.  The Job entails writing a script for a speaker to follow when addressing an audience.  Believe me, there’s plenty market for this skill. Politicians, business executives and motivational speakers are just a few examples of potential clients.
                Apart from writing, there’s increasing demand for public speaking instructors. The interesting part is that you can easily combine speech writing with instructing and maximize earnings.
        
            </p>
            <p style="font-size:18px;">
                In conclusion, teaching, they say, is the noblest profession. But unfortunately, teachers are some of the least paid in most countries, especially Nigeria. That is why establishing alternative income sources is not an option for teachers. It’s rather a choice that should have been made yesterday. However, but the next best time is NOW.
