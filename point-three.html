       <p style="font-size:18px;">
        Money issues are always serious issues. They are often a cause of frustration in homes and organizations. That’s why your income must be given serious thought.
        There are different kinds of income and diverse sources of cash flow. And it’s important you understand this fact in order to fully benefit from it. 
        In this article, we will be examining the various kinds of income to help you operate from an informed perspective. 
       </p>

       <h6 style="font-size:22px; font-weight:700;">1. Active or Earned Income</h6>
        <p style="font-size:18px;">
            This is income generated from exchanging your time and energy for money. It is the most common type of income. Common examples include salaries, commissions and service charges of diverse kinds. One disadvantage of this type is that it ceases the moment one stops working.

        </p>
        <h6 style="font-size:22px; font-weight:700;"> 2. Portfolio Income </h6>
        <p style="font-size:18px;"> 
            Just as earned income is acquired by exchanging time for money, portfolio Income is gotten through capital gain. Examples include income generated from investments such as dividends, interest and royalties.

        </p>
        <h6 style="font-size:22px; font-weight:700;">3. Passive Income </h6>
        <p style="font-size:18px;">
            This type of income is common among the rich. It is generated from assets that have already been created, and without the active engagement of one’s time and energy. In generating passive income, most of the work is done at the beginning, after which the system more or less runs itself. 
            Common sources of passive income include affiliate marketing, network marketing, rentals and digital products (such as e-books, videos and online courses).

            Of the three kinds of income mentioned above, portfolio and passive income should be the goal of anyone working towards financial freedom. Everyone must strive to get to a point where money works for them instead of the other way around. 
            In subsequent posts, we will be examining the various types of income in greater detail.
